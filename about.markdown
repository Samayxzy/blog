Hi, I'm Samay. I'm an engineering student with a focus on aerospace and propulsion.

I write about rockets, magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters, OpenRocket simulations, and other projects I'm working on. This blog is where I document what I learn and build—from model rockets to research-style papers.

You can reach me at [sgoyani321@gmail.com](mailto:sgoyani321@gmail.com) or find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sgoyani321).
